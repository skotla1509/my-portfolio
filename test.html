                                    <p>I’ve always believed that learning isn’t a phase—it’s a way of life. From my
                                        early academic days to my professional journey, I’ve held myself to high
                                        standards, pushing forward to learn and achieve more. In my bachelor’s degree, I
                                        was proud to finish in the top 1% of my department, a reflection of my
                                        dedication to my craft. My drive led me to pursue a master’s, where I graduated
                                        with a perfect 4.0 GPA. For me, these accomplishments aren’t just about the
                                        scores; they represent my love for uncovering knowledge, solving complex
                                        problems, and mastering new challenges. Learning is my foundation, and it’s what
                                        keeps me motivated to grow every day.</p>

                                    <p>I’m passionate about building technology that improves lives in tangible ways.
                                        Working at ADP gave me the chance to develop key features for their WorkForceNow
                                        OnTheGo product, such as employee scheduling and role-based authorization, used
                                        by thousands of small businesses across Canada. I’ll never forget the feedback
                                        from small business owners who shared how these features simplified a
                                        time-consuming task and made employee management smoother. Knowing that
                                        something I created helped real people in their daily work is why I do what I
                                        do. It reminds me that engineering isn’t just about code—it’s about connection.

                                    <p>One of the most humbling experiences of my career was working with Kore.ai on
                                        Mashreq Bank's Bank Assist chatbot, which serves over half a million customers.
                                        Designing conversational flows that could effectively guide users through
                                        complex banking tasks was both challenging and rewarding. Collaborating with the
                                        bank to understand user needs and deliver an intuitive, reliable experience
                                        reminded me of technology’s incredible reach. The project reinforced my belief
                                        that great design isn’t just functional; it’s human-centered. Helping people
                                        navigate something as critical as banking with ease is a responsibility I
                                        cherish.</p>

                                    <p>While I love the technical side of my work, I also find joy in supporting others
                                        on their journeys. At ADP, I had the opportunity to mentor two juniors, guiding
                                        them through our product’s architecture and design practices. Watching them grow
                                        from newcomers to confident contributors was incredibly rewarding. As a TA
                                        during my master’s, I introduced undergraduates from non-CS backgrounds to core
                                        concepts, helping them gain skills they could use in their careers. Whether it’s
                                        building solutions or mentoring others, my aim is always to make a meaningful
                                        impact on people’s lives.</p>

                                    <p>Looking to the future, my aspiration is to transition into a role where I can
                                        design and architect solutions that touch lives on a global scale. I want to
                                        move beyond just development into shaping meaningful experiences, creating
                                        technology that’s not only functional but truly transformative. My journey in
                                        self-driven projects and academic challenges has shown me the thrill of building
                                        from the ground up, and I am excited to one day design solutions that people
                                        everywhere will rely on and enjoy. For me, engineering is not just a job—it’s a
