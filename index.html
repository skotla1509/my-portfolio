									<p>I’ve always believed that learning isn’t a phase—it’s a way of life. From my
										early academic days to my professional journey, I’ve held myself to high
										standards, pushing forward to learn and achieve more. In my bachelor’s degree, I
										was proud to finish in the top 1% of my department, a reflection of my
										dedication to my craft. My drive led me to pursue a master’s, where I graduated
										with a perfect 4.0 GPA. For me, these accomplishments aren’t just about the
										scores; they represent my love for uncovering knowledge, solving complex
										problems, and mastering new challenges. Learning is my foundation, and it’s what
										keeps me motivated to grow every day.</p>

										<h3>Creating Real Impact</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I’m passionate about building technology that improves lives in tangible ways.
										Working at ADP gave me the chance to develop key features for their WorkForceNow
										OnTheGo product, such as employee scheduling and role-based authorization, used
										by thousands of small businesses across Canada. I’ll never forget the feedback
										from small business owners who shared how these features simplified a
										time-consuming task and made employee management smoother. Knowing that
										something I created helped real people in their daily work is why I do what I
										do. It reminds me that engineering isn’t just about code—it’s about connection.

										<h3>Designing for Scale</h3>
									</header>
									<p>One of the most humbling experiences of my career was working with Kore.ai on
										Mashreq Bank's Bank Assist chatbot, which serves over half a million customers.
										Designing conversational flows that could effectively guide users through
										complex banking tasks was both challenging and rewarding. Collaborating with the
										bank to understand user needs and deliver an intuitive, reliable experience
										reminded me of technology’s incredible reach. The project reinforced my belief
										that great design isn’t just functional; it’s human-centered. Helping people
										navigate something as critical as banking with ease is a responsibility I
										cherish.</p>

										<h3>Mentorship and Collaboration</h3>
									</header>
									<p>While I love the technical side of my work, I also find joy in supporting others
										on their journeys. At ADP, I had the opportunity to mentor two juniors, guiding
										them through our product’s architecture and design practices. Watching them grow
										from newcomers to confident contributors was incredibly rewarding. As a TA
										during my master’s, I introduced undergraduates from non-CS backgrounds to core
										concepts, helping them gain skills they could use in their careers. Whether it’s
										building solutions or mentoring others, my aim is always to make a meaningful
										impact on people’s lives.</p>

										<h3>Building Tomorrow’s Solutions</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Looking to the future, my aspiration is to transition into a role where I can
										design and architect solutions that touch lives on a global scale. I want to
										move beyond just development into shaping meaningful experiences, creating
										technology that’s not only functional but truly transformative. My journey in
										self-driven projects and academic challenges has shown me the thrill of building
										from the ground up, and I am excited to one day design solutions that people
										everywhere will rely on and enjoy. For me, engineering is not just a job—it’s a
										way to connect, innovate, and empower.</p>
